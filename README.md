# Orchid-Website

This project involves designing a website to store and display orchid data for orchids found in Canada. The primary goal was to demonstrate proficiency in HTML and CSS, display effective JavaScript usage, and dynamically manipulate the DOM. The website features checkboxes and a search field, where search results are actively modified as checkboxes are checked and unchecked, and update as the user types in the search field. The search field includes input validation, accepting only specific character types and placing limits on the number of characters the user can enter. Additionally, the website incorporates alerts and modals to enhance the user experience. 

Furthermore, the website was deployed on AWS to be publicly accessible. 

I'd be happy to discuss this project further - feel free to reach out if you'd like more details.
